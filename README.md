- # Welcome to My GitHub Playground!

Hey there, I'm Shreeja Sarkar, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at St. Thomas College of Engineering and Technology. I'm currently working towards my BTech degree, set to graduate in the year 2025. 👩‍🎓

## About Me

I'm on a mission to craft digital experiences that combine art and technology. As of now, I specialize in front-end development, creating stunning user interfaces that captivate and engage. But that's just the beginning! My journey is all about evolution, and I'm excited to expand my skills to become a full-stack web developer in the near future.

## Current Focus

My current focus is on mastering the art of front-end development. From building responsive layouts to creating interactive user interfaces, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved through web technologies. I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring modern front-end frameworks to stay ahead of the curve.
